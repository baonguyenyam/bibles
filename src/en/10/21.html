            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Then there was a famine in the days of <span class="person">David</span> three years, year after year; and <span class="person">David</span> enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for <span class="person">Saul</span>,
              and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> had
              sworn unto them: and <span class="person">Saul</span> sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> and <span class="person">Judah</span>.)
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Wherefore <span class="person">David</span> said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of <span class="person">Saul</span>, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in <span class="place">Israel</span>. And he
              said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of <span class="place">Israel</span>,
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of <span class="person">Saul</span>, whom the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give them.
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of <span class="person">Saul</span>, because of the LORD's oath that was between them, between <span class="person">David</span> and Jonathan the
              son of <span class="person">Saul</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto <span class="person">Saul</span>, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of <span class="person">Saul</span>,
              whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days,
              in the beginning of barley harvest.
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air
              to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And it was told <span class="person">David</span> what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of <span class="person">Saul</span>, had done.
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And <span class="person">David</span> went and took the bones of <span class="person">Saul</span> and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan,
              where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain <span class="person">Saul</span> in Gilboa:
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And he brought up from thence the bones of <span class="person">Saul</span> and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And the bones of <span class="person">Saul</span> and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of <span class="person">Benjamin</span> in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed
              all that the king commanded. And after that God was intreated for the land.
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with <span class="place">Israel</span>; and <span class="person">David</span> went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and
              <span
              class="person">David</span>waxed faint.
                <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain <span class="person">David</span>.
                <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the <span class="place">Philistine</span>, and killed him. Then the men of <span class="person">David</span> sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go
                no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of <span class="place">Israel</span>.
                <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.
                <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's
                beam.
                <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.
                <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And when he defied <span class="place">Israel</span>, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of <span class="person">David</span> slew him.
                <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of <span class="person">David</span>, and by the hand of his servants.</p>
