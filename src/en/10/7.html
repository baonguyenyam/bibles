            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the LORD is with thee.
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> Go and tell my servant <span class="person">David</span>, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, even to this day, but have walked in a tent
              and in a tabernacle.
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> spake I a word with any of the tribes of <span class="place">Israel</span>, whom I commanded to feed my people
              <span
              class="place">Israel</span>, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?
                <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant <span class="person">David</span>, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over
                <span
                class="place">Israel</span>:
                  <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.
                  <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> Moreover I will appoint a place for my people <span class="place">Israel</span>, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness
                  afflict them any more, as beforetime,
                  <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people <span class="place">Israel</span>, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make
                  thee an house.
                  <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
                  <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
                  <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:
                  <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from <span class="person">Saul</span>, whom I put away before thee.
                  <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.
                  <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto <span class="person">David</span>.
                  <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Then went king <span class="person">David</span> in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?
                  <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?
                  <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And what can <span class="person">David</span> say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.
                  <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.
                  <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
                  <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like <span class="place">Israel</span>, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things
                  and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from <span class="place">Egypt</span>, from the nations and their gods?
                  <br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people <span class="place">Israel</span> to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.
                  <br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said.
                  <br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over <span class="place">Israel</span>: and let the house of thy servant <span class="person">David</span> be established
                  before thee.
                  <br><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of <span class="place">Israel</span>, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer
                  unto thee.
                  <br><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:
                  <br><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant
                  be blessed for ever.</p>
