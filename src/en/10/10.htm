            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Then said <span class="person">David</span>, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And <span class="person">David</span> sent to comfort him by the hand
              of his servants for his father. And <span class="person">David</span>'s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that <span class="person">David</span> doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not <span class="person">David</span> rather
              sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Wherefore Hanun took <span class="person">David</span>'s servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> When they told it unto <span class="person">David</span>, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at <span class="place">Jericho</span> until your beards be grown,
              and then return.
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before <span class="person">David</span>, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen,
              and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And when <span class="person">David</span> heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of <span class="place">Israel</span>, and put them in array against the Syrians:
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon.
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good.
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before <span class="place">Israel</span>, they gathered themselves together.
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And when it was told <span class="person">David</span>, he gathered all <span class="place">Israel</span> together, and passed over <span class="place">Jordan</span>, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set
              themselves in array against <span class="person">David</span>, and fought with him.
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And the Syrians fled before <span class="place">Israel</span>; and <span class="person">David</span> slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach
              the captain of their host, who died there.
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before <span class="place">Israel</span>, they made peace with <span class="place">Israel</span>, and served them. So the
              Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.</p>
