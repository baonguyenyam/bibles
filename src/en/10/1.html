            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Now it came to pass after the death of <span class="person">Saul</span>, when <span class="person">David</span> was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and <span class="person">David</span> had abode
              two days in Ziklag;
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from <span class="person">Saul</span> with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to <span class="person">David</span>,
              that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And <span class="person">David</span> said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of <span class="place">Israel</span> am I escaped.
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And <span class="person">David</span> said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead;
              and <span class="person">Saul</span> and Jonathan his son are dead also.
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And <span class="person">David</span> said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that <span class="person">Saul</span> and Jonathan his son be dead?
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, <span class="person">Saul</span> leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought
              them hither unto my lord.
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Then <span class="person">David</span> took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for <span class="person">Saul</span>, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of <span class="place">Israel</span>;
              because they were fallen by the sword.
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And <span class="person">David</span> said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And <span class="person">David</span> said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And <span class="person">David</span> called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And <span class="person">David</span> said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And <span class="person">David</span> lamented with this lamentation over <span class="person">Saul</span> and over Jonathan his son:
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> (Also he bade them teach the children of <span class="person">Judah</span> the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> The beauty of <span class="place">Israel</span> is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of <span class="person">Saul</span>,
              as though he had not been anointed with oil.
              <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of <span class="person">Saul</span> returned not empty.
              <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span>  <span class="person">Saul</span> and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
              <br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> Ye daughters of <span class="place">Israel</span>, weep over <span class="person">Saul</span>, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
              <br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.
              <br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.
              <br><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</p>
