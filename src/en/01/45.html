            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Then <span class="person">Joseph</span> could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while <span class="person">Joseph</span> made
              himself known unto his brethren.
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And <span class="person">Joseph</span> said unto his brethren, I am <span class="person">Joseph</span>; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And <span class="person">Joseph</span> said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am <span class="person">Joseph</span> your brother, whom ye sold into <span class="place">Egypt</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son <span class="person">Joseph</span>, God hath made me lord of all <span class="place">Egypt</span>: come down unto me, tarry not:
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And thou shalt dwell in the land of <span class="place">Goshen</span>, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou
              hast:
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother <span class="person">Benjamin</span>, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And he fell upon his brother <span class="person">Benjamin</span>'s neck, and wept; and <span class="person">Benjamin</span> wept upon his neck.
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, <span class="person">Joseph</span>'s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And Pharaoh said unto <span class="person">Joseph</span>, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of <span class="place">Canaan</span>;
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span> for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span> is yours.
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> did so: and <span class="person">Joseph</span> gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
              <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to <span class="person">Benjamin</span> he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.
              <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.
              <br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.
              <br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And they went up out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and came into the land of <span class="place">Canaan</span> unto <span class="person">Jacob</span> their father,
              <br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And told him, saying, <span class="person">Joseph</span> is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>. And <span class="person">Jacob</span>'s heart fainted, for
              he believed them not.
              <br><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And they told him all the words of <span class="person">Joseph</span>, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which <span class="person">Joseph</span> had sent to carry him, the spirit of
              <span
              class="person">Jacob</span>their father revived:
                <br><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And <span class="place">Israel</span> said, It is enough; <span class="person">Joseph</span> my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.</p>
