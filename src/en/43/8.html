            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span>  <span class="person">Jesus</span> went unto the mount of Olives.
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> Now <span class="person">Moses</span> in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But <span class="person">Jesus</span> stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, <span class="word">He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and <span class="person">Jesus</span> was left alone, and the woman standing
              in the midst.
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> When <span class="person">Jesus</span> had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, <span class="word">Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> She said, No man, Lord. And <span class="person">Jesus</span> said unto her, <span class="word">Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Then spake <span class="person">Jesus</span> again unto them, saying, <span class="word">I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span>  <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered and said unto them, <span class="word">Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span>  <span class="word">Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span>  <span class="word">And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span>  <span class="word">It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span>  <span class="word">I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered, <span class="word">Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> These words spake <span class="person">Jesus</span> in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> Then said <span class="person">Jesus</span> again unto them, <span class="word">I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, <span class="word">Whither I go, ye cannot come.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And he said unto them, <span class="word">Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span>  <span class="word">I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And <span class="person">Jesus</span> saith unto them, <span class="word">Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span>  <span class="word">I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.
              <br><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> Then said <span class="person">Jesus</span> unto them, <span class="word">When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="29">29</span>  <span class="word">And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> As he spake these words, many believed on him.
              <br><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> Then said <span class="person">Jesus</span> to those Jews which believed on him, <span class="word">If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="32">32</span>  <span class="word">And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> They answered him, We be <span class="person">Abraham</span>'s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?
              <br><span class="verse" id="34">34</span>  <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered them, <span class="word">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="35">35</span><span class="word"> And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="36">36</span><span class="word"> If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="37">37</span><span class="word"> I know that ye are <span class="person">Abraham</span>'s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="38">38</span><span class="word"> I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> They answered and said unto him, <span class="person">Abraham</span> is our father. <span class="person">Jesus</span> saith unto them, <span class="word">If ye were <span class="person">Abraham</span>'s children,
              ye would do the works of <span class="person">Abraham</span>.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="40">40</span>  <span class="word">But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not <span class="person">Abraham</span>.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="41">41</span><span class="word"> Ye do the deeds of your father.</span> Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.
              <br><span class="verse" id="42">42</span>  <span class="person">Jesus</span> said unto them, <span class="word">If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="43">43</span>  <span class="word">Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="44">44</span>  <span class="word">Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="45">45</span>  <span class="word">And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="46">46</span><span class="word"> Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="47">47</span><span class="word"> He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="48">48</span> Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?
              <br><span class="verse" id="49">49</span>  <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered, <span class="word">I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="50">50</span>  <span class="word">And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="51">51</span>  <span class="word">Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="52">52</span> Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. <span class="person">Abraham</span> is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, <span class="word">If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="53">53</span> Art thou greater than our father <span class="person">Abraham</span>, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?
              <br><span class="verse" id="54">54</span>  <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered, <span class="word">If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="55">55</span>  <span class="word">Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="56">56</span>  <span class="word">Your father <span class="person">Abraham</span> rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="57">57</span> Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen <span class="person">Abraham</span>?
              <br><span class="verse" id="58">58</span>  <span class="person">Jesus</span> said unto them, <span class="word">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before <span class="person">Abraham</span> was, I am.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="59">59</span> Then took they up stones to cast at him: but <span class="person">Jesus</span> hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</p>
