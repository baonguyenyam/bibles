            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> These words spake <span class="person">Jesus</span>, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, <span class="word">Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span>  <span class="word">As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span>  <span class="word">And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and <span class="person">Jesus</span>  <span class="person">Christ</span>, whom thou hast sent.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span>  <span class="word">I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span>  <span class="word">And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span>  <span class="word">I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span>  <span class="word">Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span>  <span class="word">For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span>  <span class="word">I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span>  <span class="word">And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span>  <span class="word">And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span>  <span class="word">While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span>  <span class="word">And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span>  <span class="word">I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span>  <span class="word">I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span>  <span class="word">They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span>  <span class="word">Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span>  <span class="word">As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span>  <span class="word">And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span>  <span class="word">Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span>  <span class="word">That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span>  <span class="word">And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span>  <span class="word">I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span>  <span class="word">Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span>  <span class="word">O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span>  <span class="word">And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.</span>
