            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span>  <span class="word">I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span>  <span class="word">Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span><span class="word"> Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span>  <span class="word">Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span>  <span class="word">I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span>  <span class="word">If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span>  <span class="word">If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span>  <span class="word">Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span>  <span class="word">As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span>  <span class="word">If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span>  <span class="word">These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span>  <span class="word">This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span>  <span class="word">Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span>  <span class="word">Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span>  <span class="word">Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span>  <span class="word">Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span>  <span class="word">These things I command you, that ye love one another.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span>  <span class="word">If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span>  <span class="word">If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span>  <span class="word">Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span>  <span class="word">But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span>  <span class="word">If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span>  <span class="word">He that hateth me hateth my Father also.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span>  <span class="word">If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span>  <span class="word">But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span>  <span class="word">But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="27">27</span>  <span class="word">And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.</span>
