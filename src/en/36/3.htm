she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.<br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.<br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.<br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.<br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.<br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings.<br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.<br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.<br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> From beyond the rivers of <span class="place">Ethiopia</span> my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.<br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.<br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.<br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> The remnant of <span class="place">Israel</span> shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.<br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O <span class="place">Israel</span>; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of <span class="place">Israel</span>, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.<br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> In that day it shall be said to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.<br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.<br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.<br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame.<br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD.</p><!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... --></div></div><!-- /textOptions --></div><!-- /ym-wbox end --></div><!-- /ym-wrapper end --></div><!-- /main --><div class="ym-wrapper"><div class="ym-wbox"><div class="alignRight ym-noprint"><p><a title="Print this page" href="javascript:window.print()" class="ym-button"><i class="icon-print icon-white"></i>Print</a> <a class="ym-button" title="Page TOP" href="#mytop"><i class="icon-circle-arrow-up icon-white"></i> Top</a><!--next chapter start--> <a class="ym-button" title="Next chapter" href="../37/1.htm#0"><i class="icon-circle-arrow-up icon-white"></i>&#9655;</a></p><!--next chapter end--></div></div></div><footer><div class="ym-wrapper"><div class="ym-wbox"><p class="alignCenter">Â© Elevate Community Church.
