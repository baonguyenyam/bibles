            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and <span class="person">Jesus</span> seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; <span class="word">Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And <span class="person">Jesus</span> knowing their thoughts said, <span class="word">Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span>  <span class="word">For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span>  <span class="word">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins,</span> (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) <span class="word">Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And he arose, and departed to his house.
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men.
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And as <span class="person">Jesus</span> passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named <span class="person">Matthew</span>, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, <span class="word">Follow me.</span> And
              he arose, and followed him.
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And it came to pass, as <span class="person">Jesus</span> sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> But when <span class="person">Jesus</span> heard that, he said unto them, <span class="word">They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span>  <span class="word">But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Then came to him the disciples of <span class="person">John</span>, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And <span class="person">Jesus</span> said unto them, <span class="word">Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span>  <span class="word">No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span>  <span class="word">Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And <span class="person">Jesus</span> arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.
              <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> But <span class="person">Jesus</span> turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, <span class="word">Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole.</span> And the woman was made whole from
              that hour.
              <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And when <span class="person">Jesus</span> came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,
              <br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> He said unto them, <span class="word">Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth.</span> And they laughed him to scorn.
              <br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.
              <br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.
              <br><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And when <span class="person">Jesus</span> departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou son of <span class="person">David</span>, have mercy on us.
              <br><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and <span class="person">Jesus</span> saith unto them, <span class="word">Believe ye that I am able to do this?</span> They said unto him, Yea,
              Lord.
              <br><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> Then touched he their eyes, saying, <span class="word">According to your faith be it unto you.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And their eyes were opened; and <span class="person">Jesus</span> straitly charged them, saying, <span class="word">See that no man know it.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.
              <br><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.
              <br><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in <span class="place">Israel</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.
              <br><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And <span class="person">Jesus</span> went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the
              people.
              <br><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.
              <br><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> Then saith he unto his disciples, <span class="word">The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="38">38</span>  <span class="word">Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.</span>
