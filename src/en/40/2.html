            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Now when <span class="person">Jesus</span> was born in <span class="place">Bethlehem</span> of <span class="place">Judaea</span> in the days of <span class="person">Herod</span> the king, behold, there came wise
              men from the east to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>,
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> When <span class="person">Herod</span> the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> with him.
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where <span class="person">Christ</span> should be born.
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And they said unto him, In <span class="place">Bethlehem</span> of <span class="place">Judaea</span>: for thus it is written by the prophet,
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And thou <span class="place">Bethlehem</span>, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people <span class="place">Israel</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Then <span class="person">Herod</span>, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And he sent them to <span class="place">Bethlehem</span>, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with <span class="person">Mary</span> his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented
              unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to <span class="person">Herod</span>, they departed into their own country another way.
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to <span class="person">Joseph</span> in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into <span class="place">Egypt</span>,
              and be thou there until I bring thee word: for <span class="person">Herod</span> will seek the young child to destroy him.
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into <span class="place">Egypt</span>:
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And was there until the death of <span class="person">Herod</span>: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of <span class="place">Egypt</span> have I called my
              son.
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> Then <span class="person">Herod</span>, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in <span class="place">Bethlehem</span>,
              and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> In <span class="place">Rama</span> was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, <span class="person">Rachel</span> weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they
              are not.
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> But when <span class="person">Herod</span> was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to <span class="person">Joseph</span> in <span class="place">Egypt</span>,
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of <span class="place">Israel</span>: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of <span class="place">Israel</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in <span class="place">Judaea</span> in the room of his father <span class="person">Herod</span>, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of
              God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of <span class="place">Galilee</span>:
              <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And he came and dwelt in a city called <span class="place">Nazareth</span>: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</p>
