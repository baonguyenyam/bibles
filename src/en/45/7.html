            <h3>Chapter 7</h3>
            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be
              married to another man.
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of <span class="person">Christ</span>; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should
              bring forth fruit unto God.
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.
              <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:
              <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
              <br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
              <br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> I thank God through <span class="person">Jesus</span>  <span class="person">Christ</span> our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</p>
