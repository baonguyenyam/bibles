but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.<br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.<br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to <span class="person">Christ</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span>:<br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord <span class="person">Jesus</span> <span class="person">Christ</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Wherefore receive ye one another, as <span class="person">Christ</span> also received us to the glory of God.<br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> Now I say that <span class="person">Jesus</span> <span class="person">Christ</span> was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:<br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.<br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.<br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.<br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of <span class="person">Jesse</span>, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.<br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.<br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.<br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,<br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> That I should be the minister of <span class="person">Jesus</span> <span class="person">Christ</span> to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.<br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> I have therefore whereof I may glory through <span class="person">Jesus</span> <span class="person">Christ</span> in those things which pertain to God.<br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which <span class="person">Christ</span> hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,<br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of <span class="person">Christ</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where <span class="person">Christ</span> was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:<br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.<br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.<br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;<br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.<br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> But now I go unto <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> to minister unto the saints.<br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> For it hath pleased them of <span class="place">Macedonia</span> and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.<br><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.<br><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of <span class="person">Christ</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord <span class="person">Jesus</span> <span class="person">Christ</span>'s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;<br><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in <span class="place">Judaea</span>; and that my service which I have for <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> may be accepted of the saints;<br><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.<br><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> Now the God of peace be with you all.
