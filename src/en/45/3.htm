Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)<br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?<br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?<br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.<br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;<br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:<br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.<br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.<br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:<br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:<br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Their feet are swift to shed blood:<br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> Destruction and misery are in their ways:<br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And the way of peace have they not known:<br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> There is no fear of God before their eyes.<br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.<br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.<br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;<br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of <span class="person">Jesus</span> <span class="person">Christ</span> unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:<br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;<br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in <span class="person">Christ</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span>:<br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;<br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in <span class="person">Jesus</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.<br><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.<br><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:<br><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.<br><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> Do we then make void the law through faith?
