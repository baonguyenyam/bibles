            <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> For there is no respect of persons with God.
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by <span class="person">Jesus</span>  <span class="person">Christ</span> according to my gospel.
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
              <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
              <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?
              <br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.
              <br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.
              <br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
              <br><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?
              <br><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:
              <br><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</p>
