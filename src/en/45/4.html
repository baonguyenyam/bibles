            <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> What shall we say then that <span class="person">Abraham</span> our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> For if <span class="person">Abraham</span> were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> For what saith the scripture? <span class="person">Abraham</span> believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Even as <span class="person">David</span> also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to <span class="person">Abraham</span> for righteousness.
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised;
              that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father <span class="person">Abraham</span>, which he had being yet uncircumcised.
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to <span class="person">Abraham</span>, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of <span class="person">Abraham</span>;
              who is the father of us all,
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of <span class="person">Sarah</span>'s womb:
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
              <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
              <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;
              <br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up <span class="person">Jesus</span> our Lord from the dead;
              <br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.</p>
