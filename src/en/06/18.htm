            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And the whole congregation of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And there remained among the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance.
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And <span class="person">Joshua</span> said unto the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, How long are ye slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you?
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come again to me.
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And they shall divide it into seven parts: <span class="person">Judah</span> shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of <span class="person">Joseph</span> shall abide in their coasts on the north.
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance: and <span class="person">Gad</span>, and <span class="person">Reuben</span>, and half the tribe of <span class="person">Manasseh</span>,
              have received their inheritance beyond <span class="place">Jordan</span> on the east, which <span class="person">Moses</span> the servant of the LORD gave them.
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And the men arose, and went away: and <span class="person">Joshua</span> charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may
              here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to <span class="person">Joshua</span> to the host at Shiloh.
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And <span class="person">Joshua</span> cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there <span class="person">Joshua</span> divided the land unto the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> according
              to their divisions.
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And the lot of the tribe of the children of <span class="person">Benjamin</span> came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of <span class="person">Judah</span> and
              the children of <span class="person">Joseph</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And their border on the north side was from <span class="place">Jordan</span>; and the border went up to the side of <span class="place">Jericho</span> on the north side, and went up through the mountains
              westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Bethaven.
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And the border went over from thence toward <span class="place">Luz</span>, to the side of <span class="place">Luz</span>, which is <span class="place">Bethel</span>, southward; and the border descended
              to Atarothadar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether Bethhoron.
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that lieth before Bethhoron southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim,
              a city of the children of <span class="person">Judah</span>: this was the west quarter.
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah:
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to
              the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of <span class="person">Reuben</span>,
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah:
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of <span class="place">Jordan</span>: this was the
              south coast.
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And <span class="place">Jordan</span> was the border of it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of <span class="person">Benjamin</span>, by the coasts thereof round about, according
              to their families.
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> Now the cities of the tribe of the children of <span class="person">Benjamin</span> according to their families were <span class="place">Jericho</span>, and Bethhoglah, and the valley of Keziz,
              <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and <span class="place">Bethel</span>,
              <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah,
              <br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And Chepharhaammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages:
              <br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,
              <br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,
              <br><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,
              <br><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which is <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, Gibeath, and Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of <span class="person">Benjamin</span> according
              to their families.</p>
