and they presented themselves before God.<br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And <span class="person">Joshua</span> said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of <span class="place">Israel</span>, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even <span class="person">Terah</span>, the father of <span class="person">Abraham</span>, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.<br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And I took your father <span class="person">Abraham</span> from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of <span class="place">Canaan</span>, and multiplied his seed, and gave him <span class="person">Isaac</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And I gave unto <span class="person">Isaac</span> <span class="person">Jacob</span> and <span class="person">Esau</span>: and I gave unto <span class="person">Esau</span> mount <span class="place">Seir</span>, to possess it; but <span class="person">Jacob</span> and his children went down into <span class="place">Egypt</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> I sent <span class="person">Moses</span> also and <span class="person">Aaron</span>, and I plagued <span class="place">Egypt</span>, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.<br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And I brought your fathers out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.<br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in <span class="place">Egypt</span>: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.<br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side <span class="place">Jordan</span>; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.<br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of <span class="person">Moab</span>, arose and warred against <span class="place">Israel</span>, and sent and called Balaam the son of <span class="person">Beor</span> to curse you:<br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.<br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And ye went over <span class="place">Jordan</span>, and came unto <span class="place">Jericho</span>: and the men of <span class="place">Jericho</span> fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.<br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.<br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.<br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in <span class="place">Egypt</span>; and serve ye the LORD.<br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.<br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;<br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:<br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.<br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And <span class="person">Joshua</span> said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.<br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.<br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And the people said unto <span class="person">Joshua</span>, Nay; but we will serve the LORD.<br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And <span class="person">Joshua</span> said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.<br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of <span class="place">Israel</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And the people said unto <span class="person">Joshua</span>, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.<br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> So <span class="person">Joshua</span> made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.<br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And <span class="person">Joshua</span> wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.<br><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And <span class="person">Joshua</span> said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.<br><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> So <span class="person">Joshua</span> let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.<br><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And it came to pass after these things, that <span class="person">Joshua</span> the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.<br><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount <span class="person">Ephraim</span>, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.<br><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And <span class="place">Israel</span> served the LORD all the days of <span class="person">Joshua</span>, and all the days of the elders that overlived <span class="person">Joshua</span>, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for <span class="place">Israel</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And the bones of <span class="person">Joseph</span>, which the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> brought up out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which <span class="person">Jacob</span> bought of the sons of <span class="person">Hamor</span> the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of <span class="person">Joseph</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And <span class="person">Eleazar</span> the son of <span class="person">Aaron</span> died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to <span class="person">Phinehas</span> his son, which was given him in mount <span class="person">Ephraim</span>.</p><!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... --></div></div><!-- /textOptions --></div><!-- /ym-wbox end --></div><!-- /ym-wrapper end --></div><!-- /main --><div class="ym-wrapper"><div class="ym-wbox"><div class="alignRight ym-noprint"><p><a title="Print this page" href="javascript:window.print()" class="ym-button"><i class="icon-print icon-white"></i>Print</a> <a class="ym-button" title="Page TOP" href="#mytop"><i class="icon-circle-arrow-up icon-white"></i> Top</a><!--next chapter start--> <a class="ym-button" title="Next chapter" href="../07/1.htm#0"><i class="icon-circle-arrow-up icon-white"></i>&#9655;</a></p><!--next chapter end--></div></div></div><footer><div class="ym-wrapper"><div class="ym-wbox"><p class="alignCenter">© Elevate Community Church.
