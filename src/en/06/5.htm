            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of <span class="place">Jordan</span> westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD
              had dried up the waters of <span class="place">Jordan</span> from before the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children
              of <span class="place">Israel</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> At that time the LORD said unto <span class="person">Joshua</span>, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> the second time.
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And <span class="person">Joshua</span> made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> at the hill of the foreskins.
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And this is the cause why <span class="person">Joshua</span> did circumcise: All the people that came out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness
              by the way, after they came out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, them they had not circumcised.
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> For the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, were consumed, because
              they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them <span class="person">Joshua</span> circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And the LORD said unto <span class="person">Joshua</span>, This day have I rolled away the reproach of <span class="place">Egypt</span> from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this
              day.
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of <span class="place">Jericho</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land
              of <span class="place">Canaan</span> that year.
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And it came to pass, when <span class="person">Joshua</span> was by <span class="place">Jericho</span>, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword
              drawn in his hand: and <span class="person">Joshua</span> went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And <span class="person">Joshua</span> fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto
              his servant?
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And the captain of the LORD's host said unto <span class="person">Joshua</span>, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And <span class="person">Joshua</span> did
              so.</p>
