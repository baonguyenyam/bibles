Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.<br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.<br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.<br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.<br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.<br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.<br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.<br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And he said, Who art thou?
