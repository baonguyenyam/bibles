he shined forth from mount <span class="place">Paran</span>, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.<br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.<br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> <span class="person">Moses</span> commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of <span class="person">Jacob</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of <span class="place">Israel</span> were gathered together.<br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Let <span class="person">Reuben</span> live, and not die; and let not his men be few.<br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And this is the blessing of <span class="person">Judah</span>: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of <span class="person">Judah</span>, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies.<br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And of <span class="person">Levi</span> he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of <span class="place">Meribah</span>;<br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him;
