            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have prescribed;
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings?
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not <span class="place">Samaria</span> as <span class="place">Damascus</span>?
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> and of <span class="place">Samaria</span>;
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Shall I not, as I have done unto <span class="place">Samaria</span> and her idols, so do to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> and her idols?
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of
              <span
              class="place">Assyria</span>, and the glory of his high looks.
                <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants
                like a valiant man:
                <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.
                <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the
                staff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood.
                <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.
                <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And the light of <span class="place">Israel</span> shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;
                <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standard-bearer fainteth.
                <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.
                <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of <span class="place">Israel</span>, and such as are escaped of the house of <span class="person">Jacob</span>, shall no more again stay upon him
                that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of <span class="place">Israel</span>, in truth.
                <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> The remnant shall return, even the remnant of <span class="person">Jacob</span>, unto the mighty God.
                <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> For though thy people <span class="place">Israel</span> be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.
                <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land.
                <br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner
                of <span class="place">Egypt</span>.
                <br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction.
                <br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of <span class="person">Midian</span> at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after
                the manner of <span class="place">Egypt</span>.
                <br><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.
                <br><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages:
                <br><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of <span class="person">Saul</span> is fled.
                <br><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.
                <br><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.
                <br><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>.
                <br><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.
                <br><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.</p>
