And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.<br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And call <span class="person">Jesse</span> to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.<br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And <span class="person">Samuel</span> did that which the LORD spake, and came to <span class="place">Bethlehem</span>. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?<br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified <span class="person">Jesse</span> and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.<br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.<br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> But the LORD said unto <span class="person">Samuel</span>, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.<br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> Then <span class="person">Jesse</span> called Abinadab, and made him pass before <span class="person">Samuel</span>. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.<br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Then <span class="person">Jesse</span> made <span class="person">Shammah</span> to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.<br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> Again, <span class="person">Jesse</span> made seven of his sons to pass before <span class="person">Samuel</span>. And <span class="person">Samuel</span> said unto <span class="person">Jesse</span>, The LORD hath not chosen these.<br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And <span class="person">Samuel</span> said unto <span class="person">Jesse</span>, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And <span class="person">Samuel</span> said unto <span class="person">Jesse</span>, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.<br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.<br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Then <span class="person">Samuel</span> took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon <span class="person">David</span> from that day forward. So <span class="person">Samuel</span>rose up, and went to Ramah.<br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> But the Spirit of the LORD departed from <span class="person">Saul</span>, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.<br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And <span class="person">Saul</span>'s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.<br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.<br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And <span class="person">Saul</span> said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.<br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of <span class="person">Jesse</span> the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.<br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Wherefore <span class="person">Saul</span> sent messengers unto <span class="person">Jesse</span>, and said, Send me <span class="person">David</span> thy son, which is with the sheep.<br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And <span class="person">Jesse</span> took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by <span class="person">David</span> his son unto <span class="person">Saul</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And <span class="person">David</span> came to <span class="person">Saul</span>, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.<br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And <span class="person">Saul</span> sent to <span class="person">Jesse</span>, saying, Let <span class="person">David</span>, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.<br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon <span class="person">Saul</span>, that <span class="person">David</span> took an harp, and played with his hand: so <span class="person">Saul</span> was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</p><!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... --></div></div><!-- /textOptions --></div><!-- /ym-wbox end --></div><!-- /ym-wrapper end --></div><!-- /main --><div class="ym-wrapper"><div class="ym-wbox"><div class="alignRight ym-noprint"><p><a title="Print this page" href="javascript:window.print()" class="ym-button"><i class="icon-print icon-white"></i>Print</a> <a class="ym-button" title="Page TOP" href="#mytop"><i class="icon-circle-arrow-up icon-white"></i> Top</a><!--next chapter start--> <a class="ym-button" title="Next chapter" href="17.html#0"><i class="icon-circle-arrow-up icon-white"></i>&#9655;</a></p><!--next chapter end--></div></div></div><footer><div class="ym-wrapper"><div class="ym-wbox"><p class="alignCenter">Â© Elevate Community Church.
