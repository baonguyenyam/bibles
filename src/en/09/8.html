            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And it came to pass, when <span class="person">Samuel</span> was old, that he made his sons judges over <span class="place">Israel</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in <span class="place">Beersheba</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Then all the elders of <span class="place">Israel</span> gathered themselves together, and came to <span class="person">Samuel</span> unto Ramah,
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> But the thing displeased <span class="person">Samuel</span>, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And <span class="person">Samuel</span> prayed unto the LORD.
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And the LORD said unto <span class="person">Samuel</span>, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not
              reign over them.
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of <span class="place">Egypt</span> even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so
              do they also unto thee.
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And <span class="person">Samuel</span> told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his
              chariots.
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of <span class="person">Samuel</span>; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And <span class="person">Samuel</span> heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.
              <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And the LORD said to <span class="person">Samuel</span>, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And <span class="person">Samuel</span> said unto the men of <span class="place">Israel</span>, Go ye
              every man unto his city.</p>
