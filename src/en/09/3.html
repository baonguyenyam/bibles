            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And the child <span class="person">Samuel</span> ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and <span class="person">Samuel</span> was laid down to sleep;
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> That the LORD called <span class="person">Samuel</span>: and he answered, Here am I.
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And the LORD called yet again, <span class="person">Samuel</span>. And <span class="person">Samuel</span> arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not,
              my son; lie down again.
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Now <span class="person">Samuel</span> did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And the LORD called <span class="person">Samuel</span> again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Therefore Eli said unto <span class="person">Samuel</span>, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So <span class="person">Samuel</span> went
              and lay down in his place.
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, <span class="person">Samuel</span>, <span class="person">Samuel</span>. Then <span class="person">Samuel</span> answered, Speak; for thy servant
              heareth.
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And the LORD said to <span class="person">Samuel</span>, Behold, I will do a thing in <span class="place">Israel</span>, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And <span class="person">Samuel</span> lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And <span class="person">Samuel</span> feared to shew Eli the vision.
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> Then Eli called <span class="person">Samuel</span>, and said, <span class="person">Samuel</span>, my son. And he answered, Here am I.
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto
              thee.
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And <span class="person">Samuel</span> told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And <span class="person">Samuel</span> grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And all <span class="place">Israel</span> from <span class="place">Dan</span> even to <span class="place">Beersheba</span> knew that <span class="person">Samuel</span> was established to be a prophet of the LORD.
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to <span class="person">Samuel</span> in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</p>
