            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span> in the wilderness of <span class="place">Sinai</span>, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>,
              saying,
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Let the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> also keep the passover at his appointed season.
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> spake unto the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, that they should keep the passover.
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of <span class="place">Sinai</span>: according to all that the LORD commanded <span class="person">Moses</span>,
              so did the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before <span class="person">Moses</span> and before <span class="person">Aaron</span> on
              that day:
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>?
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, saying,
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> Speak unto the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the
              passover unto the LORD.
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his
              appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one
              ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until
              the morning.
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> pitched
              their tents.
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> At the commandment of the LORD the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in
              their tents.
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they
              journeyed.
              <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> abode in their tents, and journeyed not:
              but when it was taken up, they journeyed.
              <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of <span class="person">Moses</span>.</p>
