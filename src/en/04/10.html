of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.<br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.<br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are heads of the thousands of <span class="place">Israel</span>, shall gather themselves unto thee.<br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.<br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.<br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.<br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And the sons of <span class="person">Aaron</span>, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.<br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.<br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.<br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.<br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> took their journeys out of the wilderness of <span class="place">Sinai</span>; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of <span class="place">Paran</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of <span class="person">Moses</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of <span class="person">Judah</span> according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the son of <span class="person">Amminadab</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And over the host of the tribe of the children of <span class="person">Issachar</span> was Nethaneel the son of Zuar.<br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And over the host of the tribe of the children of <span class="person">Zebulun</span> was Eliab the son of Helon.<br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And the tabernacle was taken down;
