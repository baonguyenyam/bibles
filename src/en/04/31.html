            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, saying,
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Avenge the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of <span class="person">Midian</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of <span class="place">Israel</span>, shall ye send to the war.
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> So there were delivered out of the thousands of <span class="place">Israel</span>, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and <span class="person">Phinehas</span> the son of <span class="person">Eleazar</span> the priest, to the war, with
              the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded <span class="person">Moses</span>; and they slew all the males.
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And they slew the kings of <span class="person">Midian</span>, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and <span class="person">Hur</span>, and Reba, five kings of <span class="person">Midian</span>:
              Balaam also the son of <span class="person">Beor</span> they slew with the sword.
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> took all the women of <span class="person">Midian</span> captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks,
              and all their goods.
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire.
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts.
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, and <span class="person">Eleazar</span> the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>,
              unto the camp at the plains of <span class="person">Moab</span>, which are by <span class="place">Jordan</span> near <span class="place">Jericho</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span>, and <span class="person">Eleazar</span> the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> Behold, these caused the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation
              of the LORD.
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And <span class="person">Eleazar</span> the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded <span class="person">Moses</span>;
              <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
              <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall
              make go through the water.
              <br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.
              <br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, saying,
              <br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and <span class="person">Eleazar</span> the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation:
              <br><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:
              <br><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:
              <br><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> Take it of their half, and give it unto <span class="person">Eleazar</span> the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD.
              <br><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>'s half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give
              them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.
              <br><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> and <span class="person">Eleazar</span> the priest did as the LORD commanded <span class="person">Moses</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,
              <br><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,
              <br><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And threescore and one thousand asses,
              <br><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him.
              <br><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep:
              <br><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And the LORD's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.
              <br><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD's tribute was threescore and twelve.
              <br><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD's tribute was threescore and one.
              <br><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD's tribute was thirty and two persons.
              <br><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave offering, unto <span class="person">Eleazar</span> the priest, as the LORD commanded <span class="person">Moses</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> And of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>'s half, which <span class="person">Moses</span> divided from the men that warred,
              <br><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> (Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,
              <br><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> And thirty and six thousand beeves,
              <br><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,
              <br><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> And sixteen thousand persons;)
              <br><span class="verse" id="47">47</span> Even of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>'s half, <span class="person">Moses</span> took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge
              of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded <span class="person">Moses</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="48">48</span> And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto <span class="person">Moses</span>:
              <br><span class="verse" id="49">49</span> And they said unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.
              <br><span class="verse" id="50">50</span> We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.
              <br><span class="verse" id="51">51</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> and <span class="person">Eleazar</span> the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.
              <br><span class="verse" id="52">52</span> And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
              <br><span class="verse" id="53">53</span> (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)
              <br><span class="verse" id="54">54</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> and <span class="person">Eleazar</span> the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation,
              for a memorial for the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> before the LORD.</p>
