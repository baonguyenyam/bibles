              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And these are the names of the sons of <span class="person">Aaron</span>; <span class="person">Nadab</span> the firstborn, and <span class="person">Abihu</span>, <span class="person">Eleazar</span>, and
              <span
              class="person">Ithamar</span>.
                <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> These are the names of the sons of <span class="person">Aaron</span>, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office.
                <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And <span class="person">Nadab</span> and <span class="person">Abihu</span> died before the LORD, when they offered strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of <span class="place">Sinai</span>, and
                they had no children: and <span class="person">Eleazar</span> and <span class="person">Ithamar</span> ministered in the priest's office in the sight of <span class="person">Aaron</span> their father.
                <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, saying,
                <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Bring the tribe of <span class="person">Levi</span> near, and present them before <span class="person">Aaron</span> the priest, that they may minister unto him.
                <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the service of the tabernacle.
                <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, to do the service of the tabernacle.
                <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And thou shalt give the Levites unto <span class="person">Aaron</span> and to his sons: they are wholly given unto him out of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>.
                <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And thou shalt appoint <span class="person">Aaron</span> and his sons, and they shall wait on their priest's office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
                <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, saying,
                <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>:
                therefore the Levites shall be mine;
                <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Because all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span> I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in <span class="place">Israel</span>,
                both man and beast: mine shall they be: I am the LORD.
                <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span> in the wilderness of <span class="place">Sinai</span>, saying,

                <br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And the charge of the sons of <span class="person">Gershon</span> in the tabernacle of the congregation shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the

                <br><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary.
                <br><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> The families of the sons of <span class="person">Kohath</span> shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle southward.
                <br><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And the chief of the house of the father of the families of the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of <span class="person">Uzziel</span>.
                <br><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And their charge shall be the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service thereof.
                <br><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And <span class="person">Eleazar</span> the son of <span class="person">Aaron</span> the priest shall be chief over the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary.

                <br><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> And the LORD said unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> from a month old and upward, and take the number of
                their names.
                <br><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the LORD) instead of all the firstborn among the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings
