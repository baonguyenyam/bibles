(because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.<br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.<br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.<br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And when Silas and Timotheus were come from <span class="place">Macedonia</span>, <span class="person">Paul</span> was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that <span class="person">Jesus</span> was <span class="person">Christ</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.<br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.<br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.<br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Then spake the Lord to <span class="person">Paul</span> in the night by a vision, <span class="word">Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:</span><br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> <span class="word">For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.</span><br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.<br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against <span class="person">Paul</span>, and brought him to the judgment seat,<br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.<br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And when <span class="person">Paul</span> was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:<br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.<br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And he drave them from the judgment seat.<br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.<br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And <span class="person">Paul</span> after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into <span class="place">Syria</span>, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.<br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.<br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;<br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.<br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And when he had landed at <span class="place">Caesarea</span>, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.<br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.<br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.<br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of <span class="person">John</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.<br><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:<br><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that <span class="person">Jesus</span> was <span class="person">Christ</span>.</p><!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... --></div></div><!-- /textOptions --></div><!-- /ym-wbox end --></div><!-- /ym-wrapper end --></div><!-- /main --><div class="ym-wrapper"><div class="ym-wbox"><div class="alignRight ym-noprint"><p><a title="Print this page" href="javascript:window.print()" class="ym-button"><i class="icon-print icon-white"></i>Print</a> <a class="ym-button" title="Page TOP" href="#mytop"><i class="icon-circle-arrow-up icon-white"></i> Top</a><!--next chapter start--> <a class="ym-button" title="Next chapter" href="19.htm#0"><i class="icon-circle-arrow-up icon-white"></i>&#9655;</a></p><!--next chapter end--></div></div></div><footer><div class="ym-wrapper"><div class="ym-wbox"><p class="alignCenter">Â© Elevate Community Church.
