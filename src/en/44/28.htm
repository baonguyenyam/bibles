            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And when <span class="person">Paul</span> had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom <span class="person">Paul</span> entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when <span class="person">Paul</span> saw, he thanked God, and took courage.
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but <span class="person">Paul</span> was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And it came to pass, that after three days <span class="person">Paul</span> called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed
              nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> into the hands of the Romans.
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto <span class="person">Caesar</span>; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of <span class="place">Israel</span> I am bound with this chain.
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of <span class="place">Judaea</span> concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.
              <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.
              <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning <span class="person">Jesus</span>, both
              out of the law of <span class="person">Moses</span>, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.
              <br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.
              <br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that <span class="person">Paul</span> had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,
              <br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:
              <br><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their
              heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
              <br><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.
              <br><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.
              <br><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And <span class="person">Paul</span> dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,
              <br><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord <span class="person">Jesus</span>  <span class="person">Christ</span>, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</p>
