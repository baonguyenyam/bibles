I appeal unto <span class="person">Caesar</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto <span class="person">Caesar</span>? unto <span class="person">Caesar</span> shalt thou go.<br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto <span class="place">Caesarea</span> to salute Festus.<br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And when they had been there many days, Festus declared <span class="person">Paul</span>'s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:<br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> About whom, when I was at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.<br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.<br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.<br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:<br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one <span class="person">Jesus</span>, which was dead, whom <span class="person">Paul</span> affirmed to be alive.<br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and there be judged of these matters.<br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> But when <span class="person">Paul</span> had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to <span class="person">Caesar</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.<br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment <span class="person">Paul</span>was brought forth.<br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.<br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.<br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.<br><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.</p><!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... --></div></div><!-- /textOptions --></div><!-- /ym-wbox end --></div><!-- /ym-wrapper end --></div><!-- /main --><div class="ym-wrapper"><div class="ym-wbox"><div class="alignRight ym-noprint"><p><a title="Print this page" href="javascript:window.print()" class="ym-button"><i class="icon-print icon-white"></i>Print</a> <a class="ym-button" title="Page TOP" href="#mytop"><i class="icon-circle-arrow-up icon-white"></i> Top</a><!--next chapter start--> <a class="ym-button" title="Next chapter" href="26.htm#0"><i class="icon-circle-arrow-up icon-white"></i>&#9655;</a></p><!--next chapter end--></div></div></div><footer><div class="ym-wrapper"><div class="ym-wbox"><p class="alignCenter">Â© Elevate Community Church.
