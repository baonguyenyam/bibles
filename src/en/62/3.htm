            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Not as <span class="person">Cain</span>, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.
              <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.
              <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son <span class="person">Jesus</span>  <span class="person">Christ</span>, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.
              <br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</p>
