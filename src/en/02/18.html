            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> When <span class="person">Jethro</span>, the priest of <span class="person">Midian</span>, <span class="person">Moses</span>' father in law, heard of all that God had done for <span class="person">Moses</span>,
              and for <span class="place">Israel</span> his people, and that the LORD had brought <span class="place">Israel</span> out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>;
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Then <span class="person">Jethro</span>, <span class="person">Moses</span>' father in law, took <span class="person">Zipporah</span>, <span class="person">Moses</span>' wife, after he had sent her back,
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And her two sons; of which the name of the one was <span class="person">Gershom</span>; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And the name of the other was <span class="person">Eliezer</span>; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And <span class="person">Jethro</span>, <span class="person">Moses</span>' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto <span class="person">Moses</span> into the wilderness, where he encamped at the
              mount of God:
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And he said unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, I thy father in law <span class="person">Jethro</span> am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for <span class="place">Israel</span>'s sake, and all the travail that had come upon
              them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And <span class="person">Jethro</span> rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to <span class="place">Israel</span>, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And <span class="person">Jethro</span> said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand
              of the Egyptians.
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And <span class="person">Jethro</span>, <span class="person">Moses</span>' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and <span class="person">Aaron</span> came, and all the elders of
              <span
              class="place">Israel</span>, to eat bread with <span class="person">Moses</span>' father in law before God.
                <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that <span class="person">Moses</span> sat to judge the people: and the people stood by <span class="person">Moses</span> from the morning unto the evening.
                <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And when <span class="person">Moses</span>' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people
                stand by thee from morning unto even?
                <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:
                <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.
                <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span>' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.
                <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.
                <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:
                <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.
                <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of
                fifties, and rulers of tens:
                <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they
                shall bear the burden with thee.
                <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.
                <br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> So <span class="person">Moses</span> hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.
                <br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> chose able men out of all <span class="place">Israel</span>, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers
                of tens.
                <br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, but every small matter they judged themselves.
                <br><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.</p>
