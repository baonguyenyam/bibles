And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.<br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And the LORD said unto <span class="person">Moses</span> and unto <span class="person">Aaron</span>, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let <span class="person">Moses</span> sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.<br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And it shall become small dust in all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and <span class="person">Moses</span> sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.<br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And the magicians could not stand before <span class="person">Moses</span> because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.<br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto <span class="person">Moses</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And the LORD said unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.<br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.<br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.<br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.<br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?<br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in <span class="place">Egypt</span> since the foundation thereof even until now.<br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.<br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:<br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.<br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And the LORD said unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>.<br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span> since it became a nation.<br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And the hail smote throughout all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span> all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.<br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> Only in the land of <span class="place">Goshen</span>, where the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> were, was there no hail.<br><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And Pharaoh sent, and called for <span class="person">Moses</span> and <span class="person">Aaron</span>, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.<br><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.<br><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD's.<br><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.<br><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.<br><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up.<br><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.<br><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.<br><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> go;
