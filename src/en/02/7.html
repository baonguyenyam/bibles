            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And the LORD said unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and <span class="person">Aaron</span> thy brother shall be thy prophet.
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and <span class="person">Aaron</span> thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> out of his land.
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, out of the
              land of <span class="place">Egypt</span> by great judgments.
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and bring out the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> from among them.
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> and <span class="person">Aaron</span> did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> was fourscore years old, and <span class="person">Aaron</span> fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span> and unto <span class="person">Aaron</span>, saying,
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto <span class="person">Aaron</span>, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> and <span class="person">Aaron</span> went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and <span class="person">Aaron</span> cast down his rod before Pharaoh,
              and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but <span class="person">Aaron</span>'s rod swallowed up their rods.
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And the LORD said unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go.
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, Say unto <span class="person">Aaron</span>, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, upon their
              streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels
              of stone.
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> and <span class="person">Aaron</span> did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and
              in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And the magicians of <span class="place">Egypt</span> did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.
              <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.
              <br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.
              <br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.</p>
