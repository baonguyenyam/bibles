And he said, A rod.<br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and <span class="person">Moses</span> fled from before it.<br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And the LORD said unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:<br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of <span class="person">Abraham</span>, the God of <span class="person">Isaac</span>, and the God of <span class="person">Jacob</span>, hath appeared unto thee.<br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.<br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.<br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.<br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.<br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.<br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?<br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.<br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.<br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And the anger of the LORD was kindled against <span class="person">Moses</span>, and he said, Is not <span class="person">Aaron</span> the Levite thy brother?
