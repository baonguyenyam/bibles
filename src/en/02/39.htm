            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for <span class="person">Aaron</span>; as the LORD commanded <span class="person">Moses</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work.
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the two edges was it coupled together.
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded <span class="person">Moses</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>; as the LORD commanded <span class="person">Moses</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And the stones were according to the names of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to
              the twelve tribes.
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work of pure gold.
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate.
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it.
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward.
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from
              the ephod; as the LORD commanded <span class="person">Moses</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.
              <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.
              <br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.
              <br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates;
              <br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD commanded <span class="person">Moses</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for <span class="person">Aaron</span>, and for his sons,
              <br><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,
              <br><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded <span class="person">Moses</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.
              <br><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded <span class="person">Moses</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> did according to all that the LORD commanded <span class="person">Moses</span>,
              so did they.
              <br><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And they brought the tabernacle unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets,
              <br><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering,
              <br><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat,
              <br><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread,
              <br><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,
              <br><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,
              <br><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,
              <br><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation,
              <br><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for <span class="person">Aaron</span> the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.
              <br><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> According to all that the LORD commanded <span class="person">Moses</span>, so the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> made all the work.
              <br><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and <span class="person">Moses</span> blessed them.</p>
