            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Then came certain of the elders of <span class="place">Israel</span> unto me, and sat before me.
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at all by them?
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of <span class="place">Israel</span> that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of
              his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> That I may take the house of <span class="place">Israel</span> in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Therefore say unto the house of <span class="place">Israel</span>, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> For every one of the house of <span class="place">Israel</span>, or of the stranger that sojourneth in <span class="place">Israel</span>, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his
              heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people <span class="place">Israel</span>.
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him;
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> That the house of <span class="place">Israel</span> may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith
              the Lord GOD.
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will
              cut off man and beast from it:
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Though these three men, <span class="person">Noah</span>, <span class="person">Daniel</span>, and <span class="person">Job</span>, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness,
              saith the Lord GOD.
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts:
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> Though <span class="person">Noah</span>, <span class="person">Daniel</span>, and <span class="person">Job</span>, were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they
              shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off
              from it man and beast?
              <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be
              comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, even concerning all that I have brought upon it.
              <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
