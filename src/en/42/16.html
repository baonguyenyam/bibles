            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And he said also unto his disciples, <span class="word">There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span>  <span class="word">And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span>  <span class="word">Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span><span class="word"> I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span>  <span class="word">So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span><span class="word"> And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span>  <span class="word">Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span>  <span class="word">And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span><span class="word"> And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span>  <span class="word">He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span>  <span class="word">If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span>  <span class="word">And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span>  <span class="word">No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span>  <span class="word">And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span><span class="word"> The law and the prophets were until <span class="person">John</span>: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span>  <span class="word">And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span>  <span class="word">Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="19">19</span>  <span class="word">There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="20">20</span><span class="word"> And there was a certain beggar named <span class="person">Lazarus</span>, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="21">21</span><span class="word">And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="22">22</span>  <span class="word">And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into <span class="person">Abraham</span>'s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="23">23</span>  <span class="word">And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth <span class="person">Abraham</span> afar off, and <span class="person">Lazarus</span> in his bosom.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="24">24</span>  <span class="word">And he cried and said, Father <span class="person">Abraham</span>, have mercy on me, and send <span class="person">Lazarus</span>, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and
              cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="25">25</span><span class="word"> But <span class="person">Abraham</span> said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise <span class="person">Lazarus</span> evil things: but now
              he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="26">26</span><span class="word"> And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="27">27</span>  <span class="word">Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="28">28</span>  <span class="word">For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="29">29</span>  <span class="word"><span class="person">Abraham</span> saith unto him, They have <span class="person">Moses</span> and the prophets; let them hear them.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="30">30</span><span class="word"> And he said, Nay, father <span class="person">Abraham</span>: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</span>
              <br><span class="verse" id="31">31</span>  <span class="word">And he said unto him, If they hear not <span class="person">Moses</span> and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</span>
