            <!--... the Word of God:-->
            <p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:
              <br><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:
              <br><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
              <br><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.
              <br><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:
              <br><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:
              <br><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.
              <br><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
              <br><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
              <br><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that
              are therein shall be burned up.
              <br><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,
              <br><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?
              <br><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
              <br><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.
              <br><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother <span class="person">Paul</span> also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;
              <br><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto
              their own destruction.
              <br><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.
              <br><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour <span class="person">Jesus</span>  <span class="person">Christ</span>. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.</p>
